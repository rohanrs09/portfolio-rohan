last week the chinese company z.ai released their flagship coding model glm-4.6. it has a context window of 200k and it’s currently on discount.

we can abuse that.

1. go to z.ai’s [website](https://z.ai/subscribe?utm_source=zai&utm_medium=index&utm_term=glm-coding-plan&utm_campaign=Platform_Ops&_channel_track_key=6lShUDnv) and subscribe to a monthly coding plan. it’s currently on discount for $3.

2. obtain your z.ai api keys from [here](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list) and download claude code — `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.

3. after installing claude code, set up environment variables using one of the following two methods:

a. using script, run a chmod +x (i prefer this)

```bash
curl -O "http://bigmodel-us3-prod-marketplace.cn-wlcb.ufileos.com/1753683755292-30b3431f487b4cc1863e57a81d78e289.sh?ufileattname=claude_code_prod_zai.sh"
```

b. manual configuration

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY
```

lowkey feels like their entire cli tool and website is vibe coded with their own coding model.

you’re done.

tips —

to get up to date document i use [context7](https://context7.com/), login to context7 get your api key and add it to claude with `claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp --header "CONTEXT7_API_KEY: $CONTEXT_API_KEY"`.

demo —

first i generated a `CLAUDE.md` then i gave it two simple tasks.

a. we have a hero section [component](https://kombai-demo.vercel.app/hero-section) generated with [kombai](https://kombai.com/). i will use claude code to create a shadcn [registry](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/registry/registry-json) for this component.

b. setup prettier and husky in this repository.

it created a mess with task 1 so i reverted it. it did install prettier though but that isn’t a big thing so prolly the model bad, or i’m bad with claude code. see the result [here](https://github.com/ayush-that/kombai-demo/commit/07d411633e0dca10e8b791fa6a0be29dedca9f2c).
