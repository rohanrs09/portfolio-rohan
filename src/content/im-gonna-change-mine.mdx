> 12:58 AM on 9th oct 2025.

it struck me that as a kid i imagined myself solving cancer but look what i’ve grown up into. solving cancer is not to be taken literally, it is a symbol for doing something big, something that contributes to the society, or disrupts an entire industry.

working at [bez](https://usebez.ai/) has been a wild ride—what we’re building really is pushing boundaries in the jewelry industry, and I’ve poured myself into architecting it from scratch. but deep down, I know the idea isn’t mine. and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m capable of finding that world-shifting idea of my own, building it end-to-end, and making it win.

when and how did i become so motivated to work?

back in october 2024, i had sensed that i was wasting my time. all i required was to lock in but i needed someone to tell this to me. like _Jambavan_ to _Hanuman_.

fortunately, i had my awakening moment, [Karan Goyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/goyalk130/) offered help. this 30 minute conversation provided me mental clarity. it certainly changed the trajectory of my career.

i’m not saying that web dev was my _ikigai_. in fact, i get laughed off till date for doing web development but at least i was in mood to go “all in” on something. and to start with you must have one field where you’re decent.

plot twist, i caught dengue right after that and i had to take a 10 day break. that is even better because after recovery when i resumed work, i’m not doing it from that short term motivation rush, i’m doing this because i love it.

this was the time i started that “build nights with ayush” thing, #100daysofcode, etc.

i would romanticise working and a month later i saw sanvi’s tweet on leetcode premium and got the idea to build codejeet (formerly takeubackward).

didn’t take me much time to build the frontend, add auth, and all i needed was data that i scraped in some hours. in a night, v1 was ready.

this project got me good opportunities.

i even had a call with [hitesh chaudhary sir](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode) where he offered me a project to build. i later didn’t end up building it because i thought it’ll make the world a worse place than it is before.

i had to build a [judge0](https://judge0.com/) cms for leetcode style questions. this later became the final project in his web dev [cohort](https://courses.chaicode.com/learn/Web-Dev-Cohort/Web-Dev-Cohort-Live), and got built by hundreds. anyways.

[sarvagya](https://x.com/sarvagya_kul) asked me to design the landing page for [hirebuddy](https://www.hirebuddy.net/), which I gladly took on. [ayush](https://x.com/ayush_invenzaX) got me into building university final year projects for a bit of side cash—I was up for anything that let me code more. things snowballed when a senior referred me, landing me an internship at a WTfund-backed startup, [callprep](https://www.linkedin.com/company/callprep/posts/?feedView=all).

company shut down in 14 days.

throughout this period, [build nights with ayush](https://x.com/search?q=%28from%3Ashydev69%29+build+nights+with+ayush&src=typed_query) remained a constant for me, and that’s what truly helped me build my audience on x. contrary to what most think, it wasn’t shitposting that brought my core following.

now i’m excited for winters, excited to build at night. maybe i’ll post, maybe not but i am excited.

heard there’s something called la nina that will bring harsh winter, i’m all in. i’m locked in. i love winters. i like hoodies, chai and coffee. i like hoodies. there are less bugs in winters.

people get up every day and do the same thing. they tell themselves that they’ll change their life one day but they never do — i’m gonna change mine.
